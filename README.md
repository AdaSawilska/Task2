# Task2
Task about mice. The description:
A group of mice lives in a house with four rooms (1, 2, 3, 4).
Mice are identified by their numbers (e.g. '0065-0136670531').
The whole experiment lasts 3 days, and is divided into six 
12-hour long phases (named PHASE 1 dark, PHASE 1 light, PHASE 2 dark, 
... PHASE 3 light).
Write a program which:
1. calculates how much time each of the mice spent in each of the 
rooms in each experimental phase,
2. calculates how much time each *pair* of mice spent together (in 
the same room) in each experimental phase,
3. saves the results to an easily readable text or CSV file. 

The "solution" code is in src/main.py and the "solution" csv files are in the folder output.

To run the code need to intall following libaries:

- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install csv
